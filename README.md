## Getting Started

### Running the Backend

From the root directory:

```
cd api && yarn serve
```

The API will be listening at http://localhost:8080 once started.

### Running the Client

From the root directory:

```
cd client && yarn start
```

The client app will be listening at http://localhost:3000 once started and will proxy any local requests to the API for ease of use.

### App instructions

Notes will be displayed by default six months from the current date. 

Click the switcher to toggle between all notes and notes from the last six months. 

Thank you
